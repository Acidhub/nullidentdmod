Version 1.1
-----------
- No longer using a static response. Gets some random data from /dev/urandom. For those IRC servers that hates when more clients connect from the same IP and ident

Version 1.0
-----------

- no code changes
- updated README

Version 0.9.1
-------------

- send \r\n instead of \n (as per RFC1413)
- use snprintf instead of sprintf
    - no security hole, but it's just wrong to use sprintf in a daemon
- use a session timeout instead of idle timeouts
    - makes more sense for such a small protocol

Version 0.9
-----------

- first public release
